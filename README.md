### Overview

MyLib is a library management system developed in Java with Maven. The system is in Brazilian Portuguese, which is my native language. It provides a range of functionalities to streamline the management of books, magazines, employees, and clients. The system allows for efficient tracking of book and magazine loans and returns and provides detailed reports on library activities.
